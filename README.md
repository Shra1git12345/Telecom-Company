Logistic Regression
In this session, you will develop a classification model, using Python and the scikit-learn and statsmodel library. These libraries already have functions, which have all the necessary code written to build a model. 
But before a model is built, a lot of preparation needs to be done, like sterilising the data,  selecting relevant features etc. 
The predictability of a model depends on the quality of data it trains on, and so the preprocessing steps become essential.
Also, note the chronology of the model-building process. 
It will help when you are building your own models and data-driven solutions. 

In this session, you will learn how to:

Build a logistic regression model in Python

Conduct feature selection for logistic regression using:

Automated methods: RFE -Recursive Feature Elimination

Manual methods: VIF and p-value check

 
**We will use the 'Telecom Churn' dataset in this session to build a model using logistic regression. The model building process will involve the following steps:

Data cleaning and preparation

Preprocessing steps

Test-train split

Feature scaling

Model Building using RFE, p-values and VIFs

Apart from these concepts, you will also be diving deeper into the evaluation metrics introduced earlier, such as the confusion matrix.
